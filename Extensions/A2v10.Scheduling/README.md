# About
A2v10.Scheduling is a basic job scheduling system
for the A2v10 platform applications.


# How to use

```csharp
services.UseScheduling(Configuration, factory =>
{
    // job handlers
    factory.RegisterJobHandler<T>("HandlerName");
    // or (the name will be equal typeof(T).FullName)
    factory.RegisterJobHandler<T>(); 
    // commands
    factory.RegisterCommand<T>("CommandName");
});
```

## appsettings.json section

```json
"Scheduler": {
  "Jobs": [
    {
       "Id": "JobId",
       "Handler": "HandlerName",
       "Cron": "0 * * ? * *",
       "DataSource": "ConnectionStringName",
       "Procedure": "dbo.[Sql_procedure]",
       "Parameters": {
         ...
       }
    },
  ]
}
```

"Id", "Handler", and "Cron" are required.
Rest parameters depend on the handler type.
